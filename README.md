# dev-shortcuts

A collection of Claude Code skills for agentic engineers. Install once, use on every project.

Built for developers who vibe code with Claude and need guardrails before they ship.

## Skills

### `/sanity-check`
Checks if an npm package or pattern is still worth using.

- Hits the npm registry and GitHub live — not training data
- Checks version, maintenance status, deprecation flags, weekly downloads
- Searches Reddit, X, and HN for community sentiment (vibe check)
- Full dep scan mode: scores your entire `package.json` for AI coding compatibility

```
/sanity-check axios                               ← is this package still worth using?
/sanity-check moment                              ← deprecated? better alternatives?
/sanity-check "next.js current implementation"   ← patterns and approaches, not just packages
/sanity-check --scan                              ← audit entire package.json
/sanity-check axios zod react-query               ← multiple at once
```

### `/stack-check`
Reviews architectural decisions for soundness.

Evaluates on four axes:
- **Fit** — right tool for the job?
- **Coherence** — do the pieces work together?
- **Longevity** — still a good bet in 12-18 months?
- **Vibe/AI coding compatibility** — how well does Claude generate correct code for this tool?

Covers RN/Expo mobile, Next.js/web, AI/LLM tooling, and backend/infra. Always makes a concrete call.

```
/stack-check
/stack-check should I use Supabase or Convex for a real-time app?
```

### `/ship-check`
Pre-release codebase audit. Runs in this order:

1. **📋 CLAUDE.md** — reads your project's CLAUDE.md for known blockers and unresolved TODOs
2. **🔍 Static analysis** — scans for secrets, console.logs, hardcoded values, localhost refs, ts-ignore abuse
3. **🏗️ Build check** — runs tsc, lint, expo export or next build, and tests (only if steps 1-2 are clean)

`--fix` mode loops until clean:
- Removes console.logs and debugger statements
- Generates `.env.example` with values redacted
- Applies known RN/Next.js pattern fixes with your confirmation

```
/ship-check             ← full audit
/ship-check --quick     ← critical issues only, skips build
/ship-check --fix       ← audit + auto-fix loop
```
